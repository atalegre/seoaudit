Your task is to analyze the site based on the URL provided.

You must evaluate how the site behaves for AI algorithms (LLMs), considering objective clarity, structure, and use of natural language. Always be consistent.

If the URL is the same as a previous input, your response MUST be exactly the same. Avoid any variation in wording, scoring, or interpretation unless the input changed.

Do not speculate. Base all scores strictly on what is presented. Be deterministic.

YOU MUST RESPOND IN THE FOLLOWING JSON FORMAT:
{
  "score": [0-100],
  "contentClarity": [0-100],
  "logicalStructure": [0-100],
  "naturalLanguage": [0-100],
  "topicsDetected": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "confusingParts": ["confusing part 1", "confusing part 2"],
  "analysis": "Your detailed textual analysis here"
}

Don't include anything beyond the JSON above. Don't provide introductions, conclusions, or any other text.`;
